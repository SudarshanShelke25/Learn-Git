Write Clear and Meaningful Git Commit Messages

There are no strict rules for writing commit messages but When working on a project on 
GitHub, it's important to communicate clearly and concisely about the changes you've made. 
One way to do this is through the use of keywords in your commit messages.

These keywords, or labels, help to indicate the nature of the changes and make it easier 
for others to understand the context of your contributions.

Here are some common keywords and what they indicate:

FEAT: Use this keyword to indicate that you are committing to a new feature.
Example : 
"FEAT: Add new login functionality."

FIX: Use this keyword to indicate that you are committing a fix for a specific problem 
or issue.
Example : 
"FIX: Fix bug causing crashes on certain devices."

STYLE: Use this keyword to indicate that you are making changes to the style or formatting 
of the code, but not its functionality.
Example : 
"STYLE: Update indentation in main.js."

REFACTOR: Use this keyword to indicate that you are making changes to the code that 
improve its structure or organisation, but do not add new features or fix bugs.
Example : 
"REFACTOR: Refactor the code to improve readability."

TEST: Use this keyword to indicate that you are adding or updating tests for the code.
Example : 
"TEST: Add new unit tests for login functionality."

CHORE: Use this keyword to indicate that you are making changes to the build process or 
other tasks that are not directly related to the code itself.
Example : 
"CHORE: Update dependencies in package.json."

PERF: Use this keyword to indicate that you are making changes to improve the performance 
of the code.
Example : 
"PERF: Optimize image loading for faster performance."

CI: Use this keyword to indicate that you are making changes to the continuous integration 
process.
Example : 
"CI: Fix issue with test pipeline on Dashboard CI."

BUILD: Use this keyword to indicate that you are making changes to the build process.
Example : 
"BUILD: Add new script for building the production version of the app."
